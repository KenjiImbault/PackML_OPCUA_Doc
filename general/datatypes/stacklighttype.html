    <div class="content">
    This data type describes a stack light.<br />
    The stack light is defined with 3 components:
    <ul>
    <li>The ID (int) of the stack light. (The ID is unique for each machine, however two machines can have different stack lights with the same ID.)</li>
    <li>The description (string) of the stack light. (for example: "Solid blue light" or "Beeping horn".)</li>
    <li>The state (true/false) of the stack light. If the state is "true", then the stack light is triggered. Otherwise it is off.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Data Type: ButtonType</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
    This data type describes a button.<br />
    The button is defined with 3 components:
    <ul>
    <li>The ID (int) of the button. (The ID is unique for each machine, however two machines can have different buttons with the same ID.)</li>
    <li>The name (string) of the button. (For example: "Pause/Resume" or "Start".)</li>
    <li>The commands (int[]) of the button. It's a list of int with each int representing a transition number. The transition number corresponds to the PackML Tag Values. (Check the <a href="../../cheatsheet.html">cheatsheet</a>.)<br />
    If a button is triggered, it will try to apply the first transition. If it can't apply the first transition, it will try the second one. So on and so on until a transition is applied, or if no transition can be applied: nothing happens.</li>
    </ul>

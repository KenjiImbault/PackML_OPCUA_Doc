    <h1>Button csv file</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
    <p>
    In the "Data" folder, you can find an example on how to format the .csv files for the buttons called "<i>_Template_Commands.csv</i>"<br />
    In more detail (Please note that the first line is reserved for headers):
    <ul>
        <li>
        The first column contains the button ID of each button. <br />
        Each ID is unique. (However it must only be unique in the same file. Meaning you can have one ID "1" in file A and one ID "1" in file B)
        </li>
        
        <li>The second column contains the button name.</li>
        
        <li>The third column contains the transition tag values to apply once the button is triggered. Please refer to <a href="../../cheatsheet.html">this link</a> to see the correspondance between the transitions and their tag value.</li>
    </ul>
    To make one button having multiple transitions, leave blank cells between the buttons. See example below for more clarity.<br />
    <img src="../../images/buttonsCSV.jpg" alt="Screen of .csv opened in Excel" /><br />
    Here, the red square highlights the buttonA (with id=1). This button has 5 transitions: 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8<br />
    The blue square highlights the buttonB (with id=2). This button has a single transition: 6<br />
    The green square highlights the buttonC (with id=3). This button has 2 transitions: 2 and 3<br /><br />
    Reading this file using a method in an instance will add all of the buttons in the instance.

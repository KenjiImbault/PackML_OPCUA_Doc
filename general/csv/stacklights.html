    <div class="content">
    <p>
    In the "Data" folder, you can find an example on how to format the .csv files for the stack lights called "<i>_Template_StackLights.csv</i>"<br />
    In more detail (Please note that the first line is reserved for headers):
    <ul>
        <li>
        The first column contains the stack light ID of each stack light. <br />
        Each ID is unique. (However it must only be unique in the same file. Meaning you can have one ID "1" in file A and one ID "1" in file B)
        </li>
        <li>The second column contains the description of the stack light</li>
    </ul>
    Reading this file using a method in an instance will add all of the stack lights in the instance.

    <h1>Alarm csv file</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
    <p>
    In the "Data" folder, you can find an example on how to format the .csv files for the alarms called "<i>_Template_Alarms.csv</i>"<br />
    In more detail (Please note that the first line is reserved for headers):
    <ul>
        <li>
        The first column contains the alarm ID of each alarm. <br />
        Each ID is unique. (However it must only be unique in the same file. Meaning you can have one ID "1" in file A and one ID "1" in file B)
        </li>
        <li>The second column contains the transition tag value to apply once the alarm is triggered. Please refer to <a href="../../cheatsheet.html">this link</a> to see the correspondance between the transitions and their tag value.</li>
        <li>The third column contains the message to display once the alarm is triggered.</li>
    </ul>
    Reading this file using a method in an instance will add all of the alarms in the instance.

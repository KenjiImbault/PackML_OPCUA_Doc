    <h1>General csv file</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
    <p>
    In the "Data" folder, you can find an example on how to format the .csv files for the alarms called "<i>__Template_Machine.csv</i>"<br />
    In more detail (Please note that the first column is reserved for headers):
    <ul>
        <li>General</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The cell B1 is where you will input the name of the machine.</li>
            <li>The cell B2 is where you will input the state of the machine. (In all caps, using the name of the state.)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Alarms</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The cells on the 4th line will be where you input the ID of the alarms.</li>
            <li>The cells on the 5th line will be where you input the transition of the alarms. (Make sure that the transition is written <b>exactly</b> like in the <a href="../../cheatsheet.html">cheatsheet</a>.)</li>
            <li>The cells on the 6th line will be where you input the message of the alarm.</li>
            <li>The cells on the 7th line will be where you input the state of the alarm. ("TRUE" for ON, or "FALSE" for OFF)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Stack lights</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The cells on the 9th line will be where you input the ID of the stack lights.</li>
            <li>The cells on the 10th line will be where you input the description of the stack lights.</li>
            <li>The cells on the 11th line will be where you input the state of the stack lights. ("TRUE" for ON, or "FALSE" for OFF)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Buttons</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The cells on the 13th line will be where you input the ID of the buttons. If a button has multiple transitions, type the ID multiple times.</li>
            <li>The cells on the 14th line will be where you input the names of the buttons. If a button has multiple transitions, type the name multiple times.</li>
            <li>The cells on the 15th line will be where you input the transitions of the buttons. (Make sure that the transition is written <b>exactly</b> like in the <a href="../../cheatsheet.html">cheatsheet</a>.)</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    Reading this file using a method in an instance will:
    <ul>
        <li>Change the name of the machine</li>
        <li>Change the state of the machine</li>
        <li>Add all of the alarms</li>
        <li>Add all of the stack lights</li>
        <li>Add all of the buttons</li>
    </ul>

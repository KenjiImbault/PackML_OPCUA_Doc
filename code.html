    The main takeaway is that in the OPCUA server, you can create instances (aka "machines" or "units") of a class called "UnitType"<br />
    This UnitType class is a child class of the PackMLStateModelType class, which itself models a state machine.<br />
    So a PackMLStateModelType is just a state machine, whereas a UnitType is a state machine and some additional functionnalities, such as alarms, buttons, processes...
